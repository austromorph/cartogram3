about=This plugin creates continous cartograms (a.k.a. anamorphic maps) from polygon layers. 

    It is a port of the QGIS 2.x cartogram plugin by Morten Wulff and Carson Farmer to QGIS 3, Python 3 and PyQt5. Features include parallel processing, the option to select multiple variables to batch-produce cartograms, and the possibility to use a maximum total error threshold as a stop condition.
