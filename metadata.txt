about=This plugin creates continous cartograms (a.k.a. anamorphic maps) from polygon layers. It is a port of the cartogram plugin [1] by Morten Wulff [2] and Carson Farmer [3] to QGIS 3, Python 3 and PyQt5. It features improvements such as parallel processing, the option to select multiple variables to batch-produce cartograms, and the possibility to use a maximum total error threshold as a stop condition.
