about=This plugin creates continous cartograms (a.k.a. anamorphic maps) from polygon layers. \n\n It is a port of the cartogram plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/cartogram/) of Dagbladet Information (https://github.com/informeren/qgis-cartogram) and Carson Farmer (https://github.com/carsonfarmer/cartogram) to QGIS 3, Python 3 and PyQt5. It also features a few improvements, such as parallel processing (using `multiprocessing`), the option to select multiple variables to batch-produce cartograms, and the possibility to use a maximum total error threshold as a stop condition in addition to the number of iterations.
